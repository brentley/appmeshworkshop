**AWS App Mesh** is a service mesh based on the **Envoy proxy**. It standardizes how microservices communicate, giving you end-to-end visibility and helping to ensure high-availability for your applications.

Throughout this workshop we will use App Mesh, to gain consistent visibility and network traffic controls on our microservices running in **Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate and Amazon EKS**. 

Let's start creating the service mesh. A service mesh is a logical boundary for network traffic between the services that reside within it.

```
aws appmesh create-mesh --mesh-name AppMesh-Workshop
