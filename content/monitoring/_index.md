# Add Monitoring and Logging Capabilities

![monitoring](/images/app_mesh_architecture/monitoring.png)

One of the main benefits of implementing App Mesh is the ability to have *visibility* around your microservices and it's communications.

AWS App Mesh allows you to integrate the logs generated by the Envoy proxies running in your infrastructure with [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/).

In this chapter, let's change the infrastructure so we can:

* Use [CloudWatch Container Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights.html) to get more information about your deployments in ECS.
* Ship logs from the Envoy proxies running in the ECS backend service to [CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html).
