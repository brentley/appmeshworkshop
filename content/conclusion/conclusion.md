We have:

- Configured App Mesh in services that run in different compute platforms, specifically EC2, EKS and Fargate.
- Added monitoring and logging capabilities using CloudWatch.
- Added distributed tracing capabilities using X-Ray.
- Switched from dedicated load balancing to service discovery.
- Implemented traffic routing scenarios to support deployment strategies, and handle failures.
