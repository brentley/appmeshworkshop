A virtual service is an abstraction of a real service that is provided by a virtual node in the mesh. Virtual nodes act as a logical pointer to a particular task group, such as an Amazon ECS service or a Kubernetes deployment.

Letâ€™s create the virtual services for our application microservices:

```
aws appmesh create-virtual-service --mesh-name AppMesh-Workshop \
                                   --virtual-service-name frontend.appmeshworkshop.service
```

```
aws appmesh create-virtual-service --mesh-name AppMesh-Workshop \
                                   --virtual-service-name crystal.appmeshworkshop.service
```

```
aws appmesh create-virtual-service --mesh-name AppMesh-Workshop \
                                   --virtual-service-name nodejs.appmeshworkshop.service
```
